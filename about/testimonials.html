      <p class="tquote">Great company to work with. Josh always showed up on time and was very helpful and available when I needed questions answered. Roofing crew was punctual and finished the roof in a day. Very happy with the final product and would highly recommend!</p>

      <p class="tquote">I can't recommend Tar Heel Roofing and Solar enough. Josh and Kadir made sure we received outstanding service. Even though the date was pushed out a week because of inclement weather, once they started they replaced our roof within the days they stated. We had the roof replaced during the COVID19 pandemic so the response from our insurance company was very slow to say the least, but the contractor was patient every step of the way.
        <br>
        My concern was the cleanup process, a neighbor of mine had their roof replaced with another contractor and was telling me about his battle with finding numerous nails on his lawn after the job was complete. I expressed that concern to the contractor and they made sure to thoroughly clean up after the job was complete. During the original roof removal, some shingles hit the siding of our house when falling and others hit one or two our screen windows.
        They came out the following day with workers to repair the screen windows and clean/retouch the siding that was marred with the falling shingles.</p>

  Josh and Kadir did an excellent job replacing the roof on my house. The crew showed up on time, they were professional and cleaned the area afterwards. I recommend their service and would hire them again.
